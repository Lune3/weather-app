# React Vite Weather App

This project is a minimal setup template for a weather application built with React and Vite. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it with dynamic backgrounds and images based on the weather conditions. It features search functionality, a loading indicator, and error handling for city not found.

## Getting Started

To initialize the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/OhSorrow/weather-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd weather-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
   ```sh
   VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`: Runs the development server using Vite.
- `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the application for production using Vite.
- `npm run preview` or `yarn preview`: Runs the development server with a preview feature using Vite.
- `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`: Runs ESLint to check the codebase for potential issues.
- `npm run lint:fix` or `yarn lint:fix`: Runs ESLint to fix the codebase automatically.

## Project Structure

The project is structured with a clear separation of source code, dependencies, and assets. The root directory contains essential files such as `README.md`, `index.html`, `package-lock.json`, `package.json`, and `vite.config.js`. The `node_modules` directory holds the project's dependencies. The `src` directory contains the main source code files and subdirectories.

### Key Directories and Files

1. `src`: This directory contains the primary source code files and subdirectories. It includes `App.jsx`, `index.css`, and `main.jsx`. The `Components` subdirectory contains the `WeatherApp.css` and `WeatherApp.jsx` files, which likely represent a custom component for displaying weather information.
2. `assets`: This directory holds various assets such as images and other media files. It contains the `images` subdirectory, which has several image files representing different weather conditions.
3. `package-lock.json`: This file is generated by npm and stores information about the project's dependencies and their versions.
4. `package.json`: This file is the main configuration file for npm, containing information about the project, its dependencies, scripts, and other metadata.
5. `vite.config.js`: This file is the configuration file for the Vite JavaScript build tool, which helps optimize the project's build process.
6. `README.md`: This file is a text file written in Markdown, typically used to provide a brief overview or instructions for the project.
7. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file for the project, which likely serves as the entry point for the web application.

## Configuration

To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you need to obtain an API key. Follow these steps:

1. Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) to get your API key.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your API key:
   ```sh
   VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
